An emergency spokesperson confirmed that there is the potential for both wildfires to grow as dry vegetation and wind is likely to continue pushing the fire north. In northern Utah, emergency personnel are also working to extinguish the 'Rough Canyon Fire' in Broad Canyon, which has spread to about 1,200 acres and is zero percent contained. There are no reports of associated evacuation orders at present.
